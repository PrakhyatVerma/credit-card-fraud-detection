# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This repository contains a credit card fraud detection system implemented using advanced algorithms and machine learning. Credit card fraud is a prevalent issue in online transactions, where malicious actors attempt unauthorized transactions for financial gain. This project aims to identify and prevent such fraudulent activities.

## Key Features
1. Data Preprocessing: checked if the data is balanced or not, visualized the features and the relationship between them.
2. Machine Learning Models: We chose the best one out of all models.

The performance of the models has been evaluated using the AUC-ROC curve and other metrics also, although the best results were obtained with XGBoost, with an AUC score of 0.97 and an accuracy of 0.9996.
